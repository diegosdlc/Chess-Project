# Mechanics labs

Mechanics labs are small development levels for exercising one gameplay system repeatedly without changing production progression or normal level rules.

## Architecture

The reusable pieces are:

- `src/content/levels/labs/index.js` — single registry used by level loading and the Level UI settings menu;
- `src/content/levels/labs/behavior.js` — helpers for lab-only lifecycle behavior;
- `src/content/levels/shared.js` — shared board definitions such as `STANDARD_BOARD`;
- `src/content/levels/<name>-lab.js` — the actual scenario definition;
- `docs/<NAME>_LAB.md` — scenario-specific purpose and test procedure.

A registered lab is automatically addressable through `?level=<lab-id>` and automatically appears in the notebook's **Ajustes → Laboratorios de mecánicas** list.

## Adding a lab

1. Create the scenario file under `src/content/levels/` and export a factory plus one instantiated level object.
2. Reuse `STANDARD_BOARD` unless the mechanic specifically needs another board/projection.
3. Put repeated test-only behavior behind generic lifecycle hooks created by `createLabBehavior()` or another reusable behavior helper.
4. Add one entry to `MECHANIC_LABS` in `src/content/levels/labs/index.js` with `id`, `name`, `description` and `createLevel`.
5. Add temporary assets only when they materially help observe the state being tested.
6. Document the expected interaction and observable result.

No change to `src/level-ui.js` or the normal level registry should be necessary.

## Design rules

Labs should exercise the same engine operations used by production levels. Avoid implementing a fake copy of a mechanic purely for the test screen.

Lab conveniences such as fixed turns, automatic state changes or special visual markers must be isolated in level behavior/configuration and must not be inferred from a hard-coded lab id in the engine.

Core systems may expose generic lifecycle hooks when useful, but they must not contain branches like `if (level.id === 'some-lab')` or a growing collection of mechanic-specific testing flags.

A lab should be disposable: removing its registry entry and scenario should not change production gameplay.

## Current labs

- `facing-lab` — validates `north` / `south` piece facing, artwork selection and in-match orientation changes.
- `pawn-evolution-lab` — validates edge activation, Peón+ movement and four prepared diagonal-capture cases.
