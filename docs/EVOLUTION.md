# Piece evolution and carried bands

Evolution is shared campaign state, not standard chess promotion. For the current prototype, a piece that already belongs to the player band evolves when it **participates in and survives** a victorious encounter and continues into the next level. Destroyed pieces and player pieces captured by the enemy do not continue. Pieces left in deployment reserve continue unchanged and do not evolve for an encounter they did not play. Enemy prisoners still present after victory join the player band and preserve their origin faction, but they do not evolve during that transition. Once a recruit has played an encounter as a band member, it may evolve by surviving a later victory.

Rey+ and Reina+ are a joint evolution: both must participate and survive in the carried band transition. If either is missing or stayed in reserve, a base royal partner does not evolve by itself.

## State and persistence

Every catalogue piece declares an `evolutionProfile`. Units persist:

- `evolutionStage`: `base` or `evolved`;
- optional `evolutionState` for per-encounter consumable uses;
- during deployment/session state, `inReserve` identifies a roster piece that is not participating in the current encounter.

`src/core/evolution.js` owns profile capabilities, event conditions and consumable state. `src/core/campaign.js` evolves participating player survivors, preserves reserve pieces without evolving them, then adds new prisoners without evolving them and removes losses.

`ProgressionStore.playerBand` keeps the complete carried roster between levels. The in-progress session schema is version `6`; it stores serialized reserve participation and `teamEvolution`, so spent shields and royal swaps remain spent after using **Continuar partida**. Starting or resetting a new encounter recharges one-use abilities from the level definition, but only participating active pieces contribute to team abilities when play begins.

## Point cost

Evolution also affects deployment cost. `docs/BALANCE.md` is the editable runtime source of truth for every piece's `base` and `evolved` point values. An evolved unit always consumes the evolved cost while it participates; keeping it in reserve consumes no points in the current encounter.

The current provisional values deliberately make a fully evolved four-piece starting band exceed the tutorial level budget. Level 2 therefore exercises the intended choice between evolved capabilities instead of automatically deploying every survivor.

## Implemented capabilities

### Peón+

- Moves one cell in either vertical direction.
- Captures on all four adjacent diagonals.
- A base pawn evolves immediately when a move or capture reaches the opposite edge.

### Caballo+

- Keeps normal knight movement.
- During deployment it may use the first four rows measured from its controlling side.
- Other pieces remain restricted to the level's normal deployment rows.

### Alfil+

- Keeps every normal diagonal destination.
- On reaching a non-corner board edge along a clear diagonal, it may reflect once and continue in the same move.
- The reflected component reverses on the edge that was hit.
- Corners end the path, and active pieces or blocking board elements stop the path before a rebound.
- It may capture after the rebound; capture still ends the path.

### Torre+

- Starts each encounter with one shield charge when it participates.
- The first capture or destruction attempt against it is rejected before resolving damage.
- The attacker is placed on the cell immediately beyond the rook in the direction of its original movement.
- If that cell is outside the board, occupied, frozen or blocked, the attacker remains on its origin cell; the rook still survives and the charge is consumed.
- Later attacks resolve normally.

### Rey+ and Reina+

- When both evolved pieces participate and are active, selecting either exposes the other as a special destination.
- The action exchanges their board coordinates without capturing or changing facing/faction.
- The pair shares one swap charge per encounter.
- If either member is missing, inactive or in reserve, the action is unavailable.

## Level transition

`tutorial-01` unlocks `tutorial-02`. Level 2 reuses the same board, obstacles, opponent, deployment phase, music and AI configuration as level 1. Its player roster comes from the carried campaign band rather than `createInitialBand()`:

1. participating active player pieces that survive are collected;
2. reserve pieces are collected separately;
3. destroyed pieces and player prisoners are removed;
4. eligible participating survivors evolve;
5. reserve pieces carry forward at their existing evolution stage;
6. surviving enemy prisoners recruited by the player are added without evolving;
7. the resulting full roster is persisted and becomes available for the next deployment selection.

Opening `?level=tutorial-02` without a saved carried band creates an evolved default band for direct development testing. Add `&faction=green`, `&faction=red` or `&faction=yellow` to test Alfil+, Torre+ or Caballo+ directly. A real carried band always takes precedence over this shortcut.

## Manual validation

In level 2:

- confirm the full evolved default roster is worth more than the 18-point limit and cannot all be deployed;
- deploy and remove pieces and confirm the budget is spent/refunded correctly;
- select Caballo+ during deployment and confirm rows `4` through `7` are available;
- select Alfil+ near a diagonal edge and inspect destinations after the rebound;
- attack Torre+ twice and confirm only the first attack is rejected;
- deploy both Rey+ and Reina+, then use the purple double-bordered destination on the partner once;
- keep one royal member in reserve and confirm the swap is unavailable;
- select Peón+ away from an edge to inspect both moves and all available diagonals.

The existing `pawn-evolution-lab` includes a base pawn one move from the opposite edge plus focused Peón+ movement and capture scenarios.
