# Turn Over

Turn Over is a browser-based tactical board game built around chess-derived movement, faction-specific bands, capture/destroy choices, campaign recruitment, piece facing and persistent evolution.

The repository is intentionally framework-light: gameplay is implemented with native JavaScript modules, HTML and CSS so mechanics can be iterated quickly and deployed as a static site.

## Source of truth

GitHub `main` is the canonical project state. Before implementation work, sync `main` and read:

- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for durable architecture/product decisions;
- `CURRENT_WORK.md` for the current implementation baseline;
- the relevant contract under `docs/`;
- the source files for the subsystem being changed.

Do not treat an old local checkout or chat transcript as authoritative over the repository.

## Running locally

Serve the repository through HTTP rather than opening `index.html` directly with `file:///`. Runtime balance data is loaded from `docs/BALANCE.md`, so a static HTTP server is required.

For example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/`.

## High-level structure

- `src/main.js` — app/encounter controller and UI orchestration.
- `src/core/GameState.js` — encounter state, deployment lifecycle and reusable state operations.
- `src/core/rules.js` — legal movement/action generation.
- `src/core/evolution.js` — generic evolution capabilities and team-evolution state.
- `src/core/campaign.js` — between-level carried-roster evolution/recruitment.
- `src/ai/AIController.js` — minimax-style opponent using the shared rules/state contract.
- `src/content/factions.js` — playable factions and art/palette metadata.
- `src/content/bands.js` — chess-derived piece definitions and starting-band creation.
- `src/content/balance.js` — runtime parser/accessor for editable point-balance data.
- `src/content/levels/` — production encounters and mechanics labs.
- `src/systems/ProgressionStore.js` — persistent campaign progression/carried band.
- `src/systems/GameSessionStore.js` — resumable in-progress encounter snapshot.
- `docs/BALANCE.md` — editable runtime source of truth for piece costs and level budgets.

## Current gameplay model

A new game begins by choosing Verde, Roja or Amarilla. Each starts with Rey, Reina, Peón and the faction's special piece (Alfil, Torre or Caballo respectively).

Before budgeted encounters the player's complete carried roster starts in reserve. The player chooses which pieces participate, places them in legal deployment rows and spends the encounter's point budget. Base and evolved versions have separate costs configured in `docs/BALANCE.md`. Pieces left in reserve remain in the campaign but are inactive for that encounter.

Captured pieces are frozen prisoners on the board until resolved; capture/destroy remains an explicit choice. Blocking board elements are separate from frozen prisoners. The AI and human player use the same legal-action generator.

After a victorious encounter, participating survivors evolve according to their profiles and captured enemy survivors may join the carried roster. Reserve pieces carry forward unchanged rather than receiving evolution for encounters they skipped.

## Piece evolution

The current complete evolution set is:

- Peón+ — can move both vertical directions and capture on all four diagonals; a base pawn also evolves immediately on reaching the opposite edge.
- Caballo+ — may deploy inside the first four friendly rows.
- Alfil+ — may rebound once from a non-corner board edge.
- Torre+ — rejects the first incoming attack of each encounter.
- Rey+ / Reina+ — if both are evolved and active in the lineup, they may exchange positions once per encounter.

See [`docs/EVOLUTION.md`](docs/EVOLUTION.md).

## Deployment and balance

Budgeted deployment is declarative per level. `GameState` owns reserve participation, affordability, placement legality, refunds and the transition into play. Spending the entire allowance is optional, but at least one piece must participate.

Costs and level limits live in [`docs/BALANCE.md`](docs/BALANCE.md). The JSON block inside that Markdown file is loaded by the game at runtime so balance iteration does not require editing gameplay code.

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Mechanics labs

Registered mechanics labs are addressable with `?level=<lab-id>` and automatically appear under **Ajustes → Laboratorios de mecánicas**. Labs exercise the same engine operations as production gameplay and keep test-only behavior in generic level hooks.

Current labs include `facing-lab`, `pawn-evolution-lab` and `deployment-budget-lab`. The deployment-budget lab exposes base and evolved versions of all six piece types with a 50-point allowance for rapid lineup/balance testing.

See [`docs/MECHANICS_LABS.md`](docs/MECHANICS_LABS.md).

## Progression and local session

`ProgressionStore` tracks completed/unlocked levels, recruits and the complete carried player roster. The encounter lineup is selected separately during deployment; reserve pieces remain part of that carried roster.

Session schema `6` saves in-progress units (including facing, evolution and reserve state), turn, lifecycle phase and team evolution uses. **Continuar partida** can resume an interrupted lineup/deployment. Completed encounters clear the in-progress session while campaign progression remains.

## Useful development URLs

- `?level=tutorial-01&tutorial=1` — force tutorial tooltips.
- `?level=<level-id>` — open a normal level or mechanics lab directly.
- `?level=deployment-budget-lab` — open the 50-point base/evolved deployment lab directly.
- `?level=tutorial-02&faction=<green|red|yellow>` — direct evolved-band development shortcut when there is no saved carried roster.
